# Expo Managed Workflow: Obscure Native Module Linking Error During Android Release Build

This repository demonstrates a bug encountered while building an Expo managed workflow application for Android. The application builds successfully on the simulator, but fails during the release build process with a vague error message related to native module linking.

## Bug Description

The issue manifests as an error during the Android release build, lacking sufficient details to identify the root cause. The error doesn't pinpoint the problematic module or file, making debugging extremely difficult.

## Reproduction Steps

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `yarn install` or `npm install`.
3. Attempt to build an Android release APK using `expo build:android --release`.
4. Observe the vague error message indicating a failure in native module linking.

## Solution

The solution involved carefully reviewing the Expo documentation related to native modules and dependencies.  Ensuring all required native modules are correctly configured within the app's configuration, along with double-checking for version compatibility, resolves the issue.
