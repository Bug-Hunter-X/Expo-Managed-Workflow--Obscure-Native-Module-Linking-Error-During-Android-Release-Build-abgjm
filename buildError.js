While building an Expo managed workflow app, I encountered an error related to the linking of native modules.  The error message was vague and unhelpful, only stating that a module failed to link.  The app would build successfully on the simulator but fail during the build process for Android when attempting to build a release apk. The error didn't provide any specific file or module causing the issue.
