The solution involved a thorough review of the project dependencies and the `app.json` configuration file. The problem stemmed from a mismatch in the version of a native module and its associated Expo dependency. By carefully updating both packages to compatible versions and cleaning the build cache, the error was resolved. 

Example (Illustrative):
Let's say the problematic module was related to `react-native-video`:

Incorrect:
```json
{
  "expo": {
    "name": "My App",
    "slug": "my-app",
    "version": "1.0.0",
    "dependencies": {
      "react-native-video": "5.0.0"
    }
  }
}
```

Correct (After checking compatibility with Expo SDK version):
```json
{
  "expo": {
    "name": "My App",
    "slug": "my-app",
    "version": "1.0.0",
    "dependencies": {
      "react-native-video": "6.0.0" // Updated to compatible version
    }
  }
}
```

After updating the package versions and running `expo prebuild --clean` followed by `expo build:android --release`, the build process completed successfully.
